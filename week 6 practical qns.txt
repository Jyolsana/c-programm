1) What are the advantages of using repetition when writing program code?
Overall, repetition enhances code efficiency, maintainability,
 and readability, making it a powerful tool for programmers to manage
 iterative tasks effectively.

2)Write some code which will display a launch counter to the Output window 
using the Console.WriteLine method, counting down from 10 to 1 and 
ending in "Blastoff!"

using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        for (int i = 10; i >= 1; i--)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(i);
        }
        
        Console.WriteLine("Blastoff!");
    }
}
